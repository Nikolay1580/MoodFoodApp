# App-dev
Making an app that suggest what to eat depending on your mood 

This app is made by me and was begun around the begining of August. 
It has taken me around a month or so to learn the Swift language and 
to write all the code, draw the illustrations and to find the ideas 
for dishes and foods. I began first using UIKit and storyboards...
biggest mistake of my life. I enede up switching to SwiftUI and finished 
my project there. 

# PURPOSE OF THIS APP

This application is for those that cannot decide what they want to eat. The app uses an algorithm to suggest foods, snacks, drinks and more based on the user's mood. 
The application is also used to plan meals, have a grcoery list and fridge list which will prevent the user from buying products they already have at home. 


# STATE OF THE APP

The is still in Alpha and will release its first closed Beta in JUN 2023. The app is set to launch by 2024 with full functionality and miltplatform uses where 2 or more users can share grocery lists.
