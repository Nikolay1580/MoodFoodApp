# App-dev
Making an app that suggest what to eat depending on your mood 

This app is made by me and was begun around the begining of August. 
It has taken me around a month or so to learn the Swift language and 
to write all the code, draw the illustrations and to find the ideas 
for dishes and foods. I began first using UIKit and storyboards...
biggest mistake of my life. I enede up switching to SwiftUI and finished 
my project there.
